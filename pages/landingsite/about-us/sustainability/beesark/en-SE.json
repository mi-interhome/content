BEESark selects over 35 indigenous flower species annually to support bee populations. Local farmer Peter Janezic in St. Jakob im Rosental devoted 100,000 m\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e of land to cultivate these diverse flowers, creating a bee sanctuary. Even in September, the blooms buzzed with countless insects.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe joined a bee education excursion guided by bee expert Peter Lautemann from Moosburg to gain deeper insights into bee habitat, behaviour, and life cycle. Peter manages an organic farm with more than 100 bee colonies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis project is a remarkable testament to regional biodiversity conservation. After two years, BEESark conducted soil tests confirming that our 100,000 square meters of flowering meadows reduced approximately 200 tons of CO\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e emissions. This achievement marks a significant stride towards our goal of reducing carbon emissions by 50% by 2030.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe are immensely grateful to BEESark for their outstanding support and partnership, and we take great pride in our productive collaboration.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFollowing our bee experience, we took part in some volunteering work.

Lena Unterkircher and Saskia Weber visited the bee meadows in Carinthia in Austria and are enthusiastic about the implementation.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe founder of BEESark, Matthias Breznik, is an original. His career leads via robot programming to hypnosis coach and environmental consultant to farmer. BEESark implements individual climate protection projects with regional sustainability on a new level. On behalf of Interhome Group, BEESark engaged organic farmer Peter Janezic, who converted 1/6 of his arable land into flowering meadows. After careful soil testing, countless regional flower species were planted here instead of corn or potatoes. The two fields are located around the idyllic village of Sankt Jakob im Rosenthal in Carinthia. Here, the flowers planted in spring are in bloom and are actively visited and pollinated by honeybees and wild bees. In the meadows, local beekeeper Franz Fugger has made his hives available. 75% of the bees active here are settled honey bees or house bees 25% are wild bees. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe beekeeper Franz told us with much joy that he has already won a prize for his honey from these fields, for the fact that his honey is 100% free of pollutants. From the farmer Peter to the beekeeper to the employees of BEESark, everyone is working with a lot of sweat and heart to sow and maintain the flowering meadows and to offer the bees a paradise. The busy humming and buzzing in the fields is a joy to watch and listen to. The bees, as well as many other insects, obviously feel very much at home here and enjoy nature to the fullest. Next month the first cutting will be done by the farmer, so that the flower meadow will grow up again in all its splendor and the bees will find fresh flowers again. In the fall, the honey bees will be overwintered by the beekeeper; in the case of the wild bees, only the pregnant queen will be able to buzz again in the flowering meadows in 2023.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo ensure that this important contribution to biodiversity in the fields is measurable, BEESark has developed its own software to accurately calculate the CO\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e balance of the flowering meadows. BEESark is both TÜV audited and ISO 9001 certified. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor Lena and Saskia it was very impressive and wonderful to see and feel that the Interhome investments have landed 100% in the right hands with BEESark. BEESark is a partner that implements our sustainable goals exactly the way we wanted. Our on-site visit has solidified a good basis for further cooperation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe are already looking forward to more reports on our flowering meadows and a new, fantastically colorful field in 2023.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ctable class=\"\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\" style=\"width:100%;\" summary=\"news-2022-07-11\"\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\n\u003ctd valign=\"top\" style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://images.interhome.group/ezcms/content/view/full/38966/2172062-1-eng-XX/Beesark_2022_Bilder_Hoogle_Imker-Franz_Lena_Rainer_Saskia_Peter.jpg\" width=\"550\" height=\"410\" data-view=\"embed\" data-offset=\"0\" data-limit=\"5\" data-align=\"\" data-id=\"39884\" data-type=\"image\" data-content=\"\"\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd valign=\"top\" style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://images.interhome.group/ezcms/content/view/full/38965/2172057-1-eng-XX/Beesark_2022_Bilder_Hoogle_Biene.jpg\" width=\"550\" height=\"410\" data-view=\"embed\" data-offset=\"0\" data-limit=\"5\" data-align=\"\" data-id=\"39883\" data-type=\"image\" data-content=\"\"\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd valign=\"top\" style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://images.interhome.group/ezcms/content/view/full/38967/2172067-1-eng-XX/Beesark_2022_Bilder_Hoogle_Lena-Saskia.jpg\" width=\"550\" height=\"410\" data-view=\"embed\" data-offset=\"0\" data-limit=\"5\" data-align=\"\" data-id=\"39885\" data-type=\"image\" data-content=\"\"\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/table\u003e\n"
