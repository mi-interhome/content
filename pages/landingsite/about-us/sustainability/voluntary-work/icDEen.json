We prepared the ground and laid the foundation for planting new flora in spring 2024.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe next day, we hiked up the mountain to plant 50 saplings.

Although the challenging terrain left us sweating, we appreciated our triumphs and looked forward to their imminent growth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur time in Carinthia was an inspiring week of biodiversity and sustainability education.
