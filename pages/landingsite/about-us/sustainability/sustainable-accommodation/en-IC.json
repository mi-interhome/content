We prepared the ground and laid the foundation for planting new flora in spring 2024.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe next day, we hiked up the mountain to plant 50 saplings. We chose five assorted species to create a diverse and climate-resistant woodland. Additionally, we erected a fence to shield them from deer and stag intrusions. Although the challenging terrain left us sweating, we appreciated our triumphs and looked forward to their imminent growth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur time in Carinthia was an inspiring week of biodiversity and sustainability education. Ten more colleagues will join us in spreading the message of sustainability within Interhome Group after this trip, with the hope that many more will follow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe also had the opportunity to visit our bee project during the trip.
