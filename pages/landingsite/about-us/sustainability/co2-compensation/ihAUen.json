It reduces greenhouse gas emissions, promotes biodiversity, improves water management, and supports the local construction industry.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLa Gruère is a nationally significant peat bog. The climate protection project serves as a financial lifeline and plays a central role in the complete restoration initiative. This ambitious project, covering an area of 55 hectares and peat layers up to 9 meters deep, is being implemented in several stages. The first stage was completed in 2018, with further stages planned between 2024 and 2028.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe importance of peatlands for the carbon balance of the soil is enormous - even though they only make up three percent of the land surface, they store 30 percent of the soil carbon worldwide. Restoration has positive effects on flood protection, water quality, microclimate, and landscape design and provides recreational opportunities for the population. Additionally, peatlands provide habitat for rare or endangered animal and plant species.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
