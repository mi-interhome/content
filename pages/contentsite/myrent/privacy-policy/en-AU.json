Newsletter tracking\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen sending newsletters, we use so-called web beacons or tracking pixels.

To this end, the data mentioned in the \"Information about the collec-tion of personal data when visiting our website\" section and the following information are linked to your email address and an individual ID: (i) confirmation that the email has been opened; (ii) timestamp; (iii) links that have been clicked; (iv) content that has been viewed. This data is used to create a user profile and to better tailor the newsletter to your interests. This helps us to better under-stand the extent to which our offers are of interest to you. We record when you read our newsletter and which links you click on. This data is also linked to your activities on our website. \u003cbr\u003eThe information collected in this way is stored by us as long as you have subscribed to the newslet-ter.

Google Analytics uses cookies, which enables an analysis of your use of the website. We are inter-ested in analysing our website, improving it regularly, and making it more interesting for you (the legal basis for this is Art. 6(1)(1)(f) GDPR).\u003cbr\u003e(2) The information generated in this way is regularly transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. Google is compliant with the EU-US Privacy Shield, https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework.\u003cbr\u003e(3) We have commissioned Google to evaluate the information thus obtained about your use of our website in order to compile reports about website activities and to provide us with further services connected with the use of the website and the internet. However, the IP address transmitted by your browser is not merged with other Google data.\u003cbr\u003e(4) If you wish to prevent cookies from being stored, you can do so by making the appropriate set-tings in your browser. However, this can result in not all functions of our website being fully usable. In addition, you can prevent Google from collecting and processing data relating to your use of the website (including your IP address) by downloading and installing the browser plugin available at the following link: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de.\u003cbr\u003e(5) This website uses Google Analytics with the extension \"_anonymizeIp()\", which shortens the pro-cessing of IP addresses. In this way a personal relationship can be excluded. As far as the data col-lected about you is personal, it will be excluded immediately and the personal data will be deleted immediately.\u003cbr\u003e(6) Information about Google can be found at: Google Dublin, Google Ireland Ltd., Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, Fax: +353 (1) 436 1001. \u003cbr\u003eUser conditions: http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html, \u003cbr\u003eOverview of data protection: http://www.google.com/intl/de/analytics/learn/privacy.html\u003cbr\u003ePrivacy Policy: \u003ca href=\"http://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy\"\u003ehttp://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e     \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e11. Use of Facebook Plugin\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(1) We use social media plugins from Facebook Inc, 1601 S California Ave, Palo Alto, California 94304, USA, on our website, giving you the opportunity to interact with Facebook and other users. This helps us to improve our offer and to make it more interesting for you as a user (the legal basis for this is Art. 6(1)(1)(f) GDPR).\u003cbr\u003e(2) When using the plugin, we use the so-called two-click solution, so that in principle no personal data is initially passed on to Facebook. If you click the respective Facebook button (see Facebook logo) on our website and thereby activate it, you have the possibility to communicate directly with Facebook. In this case, Facebook will receive information regarding which (sub)page of our website you have accessed and, if applicable, shared or liked. Additionally, the data specified in Information about the collection of personal data when visiting our website is transmitted and stored in the USA; by activating the plugin, your personal data is forwarded to Facebook. According to Facebook, how-ever, the IP address is made anonymous immediately after it is collected. \u003cbr\u003e(3) The data collected about you will be stored by Facebook as user profiles and used for purposes of advertising, market research, and/or demand-oriented design of the Facebook website. The evalua-tion takes place in particular (also for users who are not logged in) for the purpose of displaying de-mand-oriented advertising and to inform other Facebook users about your activities on our website. \u003cbr\u003e(4) You have the right to object to the creation of these user profiles, and you must contact Face-book to exercise this right. \u003cbr\u003e(5) The data will also be passed on if you do not have a Facebook account or are not logged in there. However, if you are logged in, the information we collect will be directly associated with your Face-book account. For example, if you activate the button, then click and link to our website, Facebook stores this information about you in your user account and shares it publicly with your contacts. To avoid this attribution, we recommend that you log out of your Facebook account before activating the button. \u003cbr\u003e(6) If you live outside the United States or Canada, the responsible party for personal data (data con-troller) is Facebook Ireland Ltd, 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland.\u003cbr\u003eFurther information on the processing of your data, the purpose and scope of data collection by Fa-cebook, and your rights, as well as settings options for protecting your privacy, are available using the links provided below:\u003cbr\u003eFacebook Inc., 1601 S California Ave, Palo Alto, California 94304, USA http://www.facebook.com/policy.php; \u003cbr\u003eFurther information on data collection: http://www.facebook.com/help/186325668085084, http://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/your-info-on-other#applications \u003cbr\u003eas well as http://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/your-info#everyoneinfo. \u003cbr\u003eFacebook is compliant with the EU-US-Privacy-Shield, \u003ca href=\"https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework\"\u003ehttps://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e     \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e12.

In addition, we can enable you to use the map function (the legal basis for this is Art. 6(1)(1)(f) GDPR).\u003cbr\u003e(2) When you visit our website, Google obtains information regarding which (sub)page of our website you have accessed. When this happens, the data mentioned in Information about the collection of personal data when visiting our website is also transmitted, regardless of whether you have a Google account and are logged in or not, or if no user account exists. However, if you are logged in, your information will be directly associated with your Google Account. To avoid this assignment, we rec-ommend that you log out of your Google Account before activating the button.\u003cbr\u003e(3) The data collected about you will be stored by Google as user profiles and used for purposes of advertising, market research and/or demand-oriented design of Google websites.

Use of Google Tag Manager\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe use the Google Tag Manager. This is a solution that allows us to manage website tags from a single interface. The Tag Manager itself (which implements the tags) is a cookieless domain and does not process any personal data of users. The tool triggers other tags, which in turn may collect data. According to Google, Google Tag Manager does not access this data.

Google Adwords\u003cbr\u003e(1) We use Google Adwords to draw attention to our offers on external websites and can thus deter-mine how successful our individual advertising measures are.
