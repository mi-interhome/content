A somewhat different option  is to hold your wedding in your very own holiday home. Interhome has compiled a list of reasons why these special wedding locations are so advantageous:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBenefits\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eA wedding at a holiday home is a very personal and individual experience. Spend a weekend with your loved ones in a beautiful setting - the undisturbed location creates a unique sense of togetherness. A wonderful event that you can share with your guests – and no one will disturb your idyll.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou can celebrate somewhere extraordinary – be it in a romantic castle, a French country house, an Italian villa or a Spanish finca. The unique atmosphere will make your wedding even more special and unforgettable, and add an extra touch of romance. If you choose to hold your ceremony in the south, you will benefit from the perfect backdrop, spacious gardens and usually also great weather. Where else could you say “I do” by the sea, for example?\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e It is possible to combine your nuptials and honeymoon – once guests have departed, the holiday home is all yours.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e You have full discretion on all wedding plans, from the site to accommodation to decoration and design. You can also celebrate for as long as you like. In your holiday home, you’re the boss!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eA holiday home is more affordable than putting guests up in a hotel – plus you can enjoy having them around. You won’t often find extras in hotels such as a swimming pool, sauna or hot tub that you can share with your guests.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe icing on the cake is the option of hiring a wedding planner to take care of all the organisation.
