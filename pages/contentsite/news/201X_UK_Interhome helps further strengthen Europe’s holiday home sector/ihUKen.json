The new umbrella organization for the continent’s vacation home industry was formally established yesterday afternoon by Interhome and its fellow European market leaders Novasol, Hoseasons and DanCenter. The EHHA is intended to provide this booming sector with better international links and enhance the industry’s lobbying clout and activities.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe holiday home market has evolved into a major component of Europe’s tourist industry. According to astudy by market researchers PhocusWright, some 42 million Europeans have spent a night in a vacation home in the last two years. The continent now offers over 20 million holiday home beds, which generate more than EUR 20 billion in revenues every year. And it is figures such as these, together with the sector’s vast further growth potential, that have prompted Europe’s four leading providers of vacation accommodation – Interhome, Novasol, Hoseasons and DanCenter – to found the new European Holiday Home Association, or EHHA.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe EHHA was formally established in Aachen (Germany) yesterday afternoon. Itsfirst Secretary General is Carlos Villaro Lassen, the CEO of Denmark’s national holiday home association. “The vacation home rental business creates thousands of jobs in many European countries and adds immense value for the tourist, restaurant and retail sectors,” Lassen pointed out in his acceptance speech. “And with our new European Holiday Home Association, we aim to keep ourcontinent’s politicians even more mindful of its massive economic significance.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInterhome is equally convinced of the importance of better organizing and anchoring the holiday home sector on a pan European scale.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Interhome\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSwitzerland-based Interhome specializes in the rental of more than 33,000 quality holiday apartments, houses and chalets in 31\u003cbr\u003ecountries worldwide.
