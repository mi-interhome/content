The move follows the recent decision by the Swiss National Bank to discontinue the Swiss Franc/Euro minimum exchange rate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe SNB decision in January effectively increased Swiss holiday prices overnight by some 17% for tourists from the Euro zone. For the Swiss tourism sector, this led to many winter cancellations and also a decline in last-minute bookings. Fortunately, these developments had little or no immediate negative impact for Interhome. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever there is cause for concern for the coming summer season. Swiss domestic bookings at inland holiday destinations have fallen sharply and are currently 40% down on last year's levels. Bookings from Euro zone guests have decreased 25%.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn close cooperation with its holiday home owners, Interhome is now reducing its prices for Swiss vacation accommodation. The reductions average 20% and are available to vacation guests from all countries as well as from within Switzerland.\u003c/p\u003e\n"
